# Atmosfera
Lettore musicale

It's just a Music Player. However; it shall be the bestest Music Player you've ever had!

#why? 
...
##well, why the hell not? :)

- A spin-off of Soundflow, Atmosfera presents with a sleek, simple interface and is highly user-friendly:

Easy access to and storage of all your all-time fave jams. Even better - 
if you've installed soundflow (in the Terminal/Console type: npm install soundflow -> ENTER ... you're ready to go) you know it can download directly from YouTube and save the file automatically onto your desktop. Yay!

- if you haven't seen it yet, check it out in my Repositories!)

Enjoy! 
-buon ascolto 



P.S. I'm working on integrating the two; so that ' ytdl(){}; ' will (somehow) place a copy in the Playlist too!
