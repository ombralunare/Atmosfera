# Atmosfera
> *Lettore musicale*

It's just a Music Player. However; it shall be the bestest Music Player you've ever had!

## why? ... well, why the hell not? :)

A spin-off of Soundflow, Atmosfera presents with a sleek, simple interface and is highly user-friendly:

- Easy access to and storage of all your all-time fave jams. Even better-
if you've installed soundflow; you know it can download directly from YouTube and save the file automatically onto your desktop. Yay!

>°NB° if you haven't seen it yet, check it out in my Repositories!

# How to Install Soundflow:

1. Open: terminal/console ...
2. type: npm install soundflow
3. ENTER  

Enjoy!
-buon ascolto

> P.S. I'm working on integrating the two; so that ' ytdl(){}; ' will (somehow) place a copy in the Playlist too!

# Contribution
***Atmosfera*** is divided into 3 branches and three folders, each folder representing a branch according to skills required for its development.
- **client** (front-end) - all HTML, artwork, anything browser-related
- **server**(back-end) - configuration, database, network transmission, "Behind the Scenes"
- **shared** (full stack developers) - tools used and configuration used both client and server side, using the ***DRYKIS*** Principle: don't repeat yourself, keep it simple.
