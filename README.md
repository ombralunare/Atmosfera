# Atmosfera
Lettore musicale

It's just a Music Player. However; it shall be the bestest Music Player you've ever had!

# why? 
...
## well, why the hell not? :)

A spin-off of Soundflow, Atmosfera presents with a sleek, simple interface and is highly user-friendly:

- Easy access to and storage of all your all-time fave jams. Even better- 
if you've installed soundflow; you know it can download directly from YouTube and save the file automatically onto your desktop. Yay!

°NB° if you haven't seen it yet, check it out in my Repositories!

- To Install Soundflow:
 
1. open terminal/console ...
2. type: npm install soundflow 
3. ENTER  

Enjoy! 
-buon ascolto 



P.S. I'm working on integrating the two; so that ' ytdl(){}; ' will (somehow) place a copy in the Playlist too!
